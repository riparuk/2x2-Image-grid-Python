# 2x2-Image-grid-Python
this is a script that is used to automatically grid 2x2 images with input in the form of several images that you want to grid. the output is a pdf with each page containing 4 photos that have been gridded

To do this, we need to install a Python library called 'reportlab' that allows us to create and edit PDF files programmatically.

Put all of your image files that you want to grid in images/ folder
